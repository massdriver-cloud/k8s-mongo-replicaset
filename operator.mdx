## TODO:

* [ ] Write a design doc / operator guide
* [ ] Write bundle code
  * [ ] Defing params & connections JSON schema
  * [ ] Write 2-3 Guided Configs
  * [ ] Define artifact schema, design new artifact definitions if necessary
  * [ ] Test each guided config
  * [ ] View params schema in storybook, [write UI schema](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/widgets/) for sorting fields, etc
* [ ] Write user guide
* [ ] Remove this TODO block


_Brief description of bundle from an operator's point of view_

## Use Cases

+ rapid application development because of the flexibility of a document-store
+ replication for read-heavy workloads, "offline" jobs like ETLs, and recovery from a primary node failure

### Guided Configs

+ Development
  + 10GB disk
  + 2GiB memory
  + no replicas, just a single instance
+ Production
  + 50GB disk
  + 8GiB memory
  + 2 replicas, 3 instances total

## Design


```
            Replica Set (rs0)
      /            |           \
Replica 1     Replica 2     Replica n
    |              |             |
+-------+     +-------+     +-------+
|Primary|     |Replica|     |Replica|
|  25GB |     | 25 GB |     | 25GB  |
+-------+     +-------+     +-------+
```

### How It Works

+ we deploy the bitnami mongodb helm chart to the k8s cluster that comes in as a connection
+ an "app user" aka non root user is created
+ an additional database is created so we don't use the ones that "come with" mongo

#### Best Practices

#### Security

+ root credentials are created
+ app user credentials are also created (but limited to one database var.database_name)
+ the app user credentials are passed back in the connection_string
+ root credentials can be retrieved (see below)

#### Auditing

#### Compliance

#### Observability

+ a metrics endpoint is exposed but this bundle does not currently ship metrics / alarms back to Massdriver

### Trade-offs

+ This provisions only a replica set, there's no ability to run standalone or sharded with this bundle.
+ we don't use TLS with mongo, it can be enabled but since we don't expose the service externally, we have this turned off

### Permissions

```bash
# start a shell inside the k8s cluster to test connecting to the mongo instance
kubectl run --namespace default mongo-test-mongodb-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' --image docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:4.4.4-debian-10-r41 --command -- bash
# mongo CONNECTION_STRING
mongo  mongodb://APP_USER:APP_USER_PASSWORD@HOST:27017/DATABASE?replicaSet=rs0
# inside the "mongo shell"
show db
db.posts.insert( { title: "Moving To The Cloud With Massdriver", rating: 10.0 } )
db.posts.find()
```

To get the root user password:

```
kubectl get secret --namespace default SECRET_NAME -o jsonpath="{.data.mongodb-root-password}" | base64 --decode
```
